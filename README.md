## Project description

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)


The entire project was created by [Krystian Grela](https://github.com/GreysonKrystian/). Initial purpose of project was to create webpage for existing 
minecraft server. Since the project of server was abandoned the main purpose of project is training and expanding knowledge in MVC. The project
contains web application made in ASP.NET MVC framework and database made with DBFirst method in Entity Framework (tested with SQL Server and Azure Sql Edge).
The MVC project is likely to be treated as a beta, because there are plans to rewrite the project in a Angular (for training purposes)

Main funtionalities of project: TODO 

        
## future improvements
  
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

- create forum 
- rewrite project in Angular - the main purpose of this is to split the server side and client site, moreover is a great training and opportunity to learn 
angular framework
- test web application with automated tests
- change frontend to English - initial plan was to make whole application in polish language, because the minecraft server was focused on polish players, but 
since the project of server was suspended, the main aim is to create universal application.
